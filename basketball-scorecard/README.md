## About Scrimba
Scrimba is an online platform that teaches coding through an interactive video format, often likened to a combination of VS Code and YouTube. Instead of just watching, users can pause and edit the code directly in the video player to learn by doing. The platform focuses on a project-based, self-paced learning style, with courses like its Front End Developer career path that incorporate practical skills, code reviews, and career support for job seekers.
